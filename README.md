## FAQ
- Are pull requests welcomed?

  Yes, if the changes fit with the current theme of the server.
- Are plugin suggetions welcomed?

  Yes, but not on Github. Please suggest in [#minecraft](https://discord.gg/fVqtCsQ).
- There are database credentials in the config files!
  
  Yes, but if an attacker was able to connect to the database server in question which is isolated and only used for Minecraft then I have much bigger things to worry about.
